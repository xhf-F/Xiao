<p>I am interested in galaxies, extragalactic astrophysics, and cosmology.</p>

<p>----------------------------------</p>

<p>cosmology</p>

<p>currently, I am working on dark energy anisotropic stress based on cosmology linear perturbation.</p>



<p>galaxies</p>
<p>previously, I was working on observational data reduction and analysis, such as radio VLBI data of NGC 3079 from Very Long Baseline Array.</p>
