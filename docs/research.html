<p>I am interested in the discovery of transients and the study of their origins and properties.</p>
<p>Specifically, my research focuses on both light curves and spectra to investigate Supernova progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms.</p>

<p> 1. </p>
<p>The Search for Companion Interaction Signatures by Pa-Î² Line Detections in Near-Infrared Spectra of Type Ia Supernovae</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> 2. </p>
<p>First Overtone of Carbon monoxide (CO) in Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe)</p>

<p>  </p>	
<p>----------------------------------</p>	
<p>I was interested in galaxies, extragalactic astrophysics, and cosmology.</p>

<p>cosmology</p> <p>Previously, I was working on dark energy anisotropic stress based on cosmology linear perturbation.</p>

<p>galaxies</p> <p>I was also working on observational data reduction and analysis, such as VLBI radio data of NGC 3079 from Very Long Baseline Array.</p>
